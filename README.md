# PHYS5120_HKUST
Some homework for PHYS5120 in HKUST. The PHYS5120 held by Prof.PAN is a quite interesting course and I am sure you can learn a lot from this course. However, the workload of the homework is also quite big so there are many students including PHD students worried about it and thus they quited the course or got a low score or spent a lot of time on the homework(like me). I think it's a shame not to have listened to this lesson, but it's also not good to spend too much time on it. So I want to show some results and thinking about the homework, then for PHD students, they can enjoy the course without the worrying about the homework.

There are something noted:

-I haven't a A+ in the course and my answer is not 100% correct, you need to apply your own thinking;

-I only get 60/100 in one of these assignments. So you need to be careful.

-I will not show the source codes, I only show some results and process to help you know that maybe your answer is correct.
